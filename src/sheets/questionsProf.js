    {question: "You must have some work experience alreday, could you share something about it?", 
    answer: "Oh sure. I've worked in restaurant industry for the most of my life. From many years on head-cheffing I've got a vast experience from team leading, organizing, multi tasking and problem solving, keeping daily business running while organizing events and so on. A couple of years ago I hung my chef's jacket and started to think about a career change - I needed something more intriguing and some challenge to my mind. I've studied some accounting and now I work as a temp in the office of communal services. I'm afraid to get old and dusty in there, so it's time to pursue my new dreams.",

    {question: "But why programming?", 
    answer: "That's something I've thought for a few years now but hadn't had resources to study. Still don't, but since I started my current work at the office, I met a colleague who was very skilled with excel sheets. He showed me a few tricks how to handle data and make it work for me and that's how it started to spark. I found myself writing complex functions, googling solutions to difficult tasks and got so exited, that I knew I wanted more. That was the kick for me to start studying programming in the meantime, and it's overwhelming how I feel about it. This is what I want to learn more and do for living.",

    {question: "Why do you think you could shine at it?", 
    answer: "It's very satisfying to make things work so pretty. I've always loved problem solving, putting my brain to work, learning new skills, creating something new. I've got a good amount of logical thinking and persistance among the social skills and customer oriented thinking. I'm resourceful, not afraid to ask for advice and good with applying results to practise. I have been doing service design and development constantly in my previous positions, I believe those could become handy as well.",

    {question: "Why do you think we should hire you?", 
    answer: "Because I am a highly motivated, quick learner, team player, independent worker and got curious mind. Three months of independent studies (while full time working and being a single parent) has tought me this much, I'm sure some time with actually chance to study and learning from pros would be a game changer.",

    {question: "The most important question: Do you know what idempotency mean?", 
    answer: "I do. It's that one thing a parent needs daily, when their kid repeatedly calls mom, mom, mom with nothing to say, actually. Or when someone for example presses enter for a quadzillion times, the effect doesn't accumulate.",
